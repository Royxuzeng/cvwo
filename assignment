The problems that I am currently facing are related to running and executing rails on Windows. I originally planned to complete the whole 
project on my Windows. However, when I made some progress in learning rails, there are some strange bugs frequently occurring and problems such as files missing or incorrect version of database being used that I have to google a lot and do a lot of research to find the solutions(sometimes I cannot even find the solutions). I think it might not be very efficient to run rails on Windows so I decided to use Linux instead. Right now I am still learning basic Linux operations so the project assignment hasn't been making a lot of progress.
